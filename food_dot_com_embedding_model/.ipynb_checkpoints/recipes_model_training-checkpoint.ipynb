    "# Sentiment Analysis via food.com Word Embedding\n",
    "In this notebook, we load in a word embedding and sentiment analyzer which are both trained specifically on food.com reviews to predict sentiments on reviews for the NYT Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe (https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018055-salted-tahini-chocolate-chip-cookies). Our hypothesis is that this would produce a better accuracy that using a generic word embedding and/or sentiment analyzer. \n",
